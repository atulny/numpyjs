# numpyjs

Port of numpy to js/Node.

I have used numpy/ Dataframes extensively in Python env. and have always wonderered if the functionality is available in js/Node env.

D3 has some of it but very limited.

Due to ingerent limitations of kd some features like operator overriding etc are ompossinle to port.

Stay tuned on .. I will leep posting the progress.
